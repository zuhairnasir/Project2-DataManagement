 Airline Performance Analysis (2007) ✈️

## 🚀 **Overview**

Welcome to the **Airline Performance Analysis (2007)** project! This repository contains an in-depth exploration of **flight cancellations** and **delays** in 2007, using a dataset that includes details on **airline operations**, **departure times**, and **weather-related disruptions**. Through this analysis, we uncover trends in **flight performance**, focusing on **cancellations**, **delays**, and **operational inefficiencies**.

**Key Areas Analyzed:**
- ✈️ **Delay Patterns** (Time of day, Days of the week, and Months)
- 🔥 **Cancellation Reasons** (Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security)
- 🗺️ **Problematic Routes** (Origin-Destination Analysis)
- 🛠️ **Airline Performance** (Top 5 airlines vs Others)

## 📊 **Key Findings**

### **1. Delay Patterns ⏰**
- **Morning flights** 🕖 have the **least delays** (Avg Arrival Delay: 4.18 min, Avg Departure Delay: 5.36 min).
- **Evening flights** 🌆 experience the **most delays** (Avg Arrival Delay: 17.40 min, Avg Departure Delay: 18.91 min).
- The **highest delays** are seen on **Thursday and Friday** 📅, likely due to **increased air traffic** and **weekend operational strain**.

### **2. Flight Cancellations ❌**
- **Carrier delays** 🚁 (internal airline issues) are the most common reason for cancellations (**67,779 flights**), followed by **weather disruptions** 🌧️ (**61,935 cancellations**).
- **NAS-related cancellations** 📡 (air traffic control) and **security concerns** 🔒 are less frequent, but still significant.

### **3. Time-based Performance 🕓**
- **Winter months** ❄️ (**December, January, February**) face the highest number of cancellations, likely due to **weather-related disruptions**.
- **Spring and Fall** 🌸🍂 months, particularly **April** and **November**, have **fewer delays**, making them the best months for **on-time performance**.

### **4. Airline Performance 🏅**
- **Top 5 Airlines** ✈️ exhibit **significantly higher cancellation rates** than others. This suggests that operational improvements in these airlines could reduce cancellations.

### **5. Problematic Routes 🛣️**
- **LAX to EGE** and **ACK to EWR** have the **highest delays**, with factors like **weather**, **operational issues**, and **airport congestion** contributing to the delays. 
- Improving **airport coordination**, **weather preparedness**, and **flight scheduling** could reduce delays for these routes.
